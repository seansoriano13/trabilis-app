# TRABILIS - A Travel Booking Mangement System

![project-banner](/frontend/public/image.png)

## 📖 About

Trabilis is a comprehensive booking management solution engineered to digitize operations for Lindela Travel & Tours.

The primary goal was to replace manual bookkeeping, reservation tracking, and payment processing with a centralized, automated web platform. Beyond just administrative efficiency, the application focuses on modernizing the customer experience by integrating immersive 360° Virtual Tours (via Pannellum) and an AI-powered Helpdesk Assistant (via Botpress).

## 🎓 Story

I built this as my senior capstone project at Our Lady of Fatima University. My objective was to challenge myself beyond standard "CRUD" web applications. I wanted to tackle real-world software engineering problems—such as handling complex booking workflows, automating document generation, and managing role-based security—to demonstrate my readiness for the professional tech industry.

## 🚀 Live Demos

This project is architected as two separate applications to ensure security and separation of concerns.
